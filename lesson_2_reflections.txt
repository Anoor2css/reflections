What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        lesson_1_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

that's the log of the git init and git status,initialize a repository to  start a new project with version-control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A kind of intermediary, like the bridge link the working directory and the staging area, when you wanna add some files you should put it on the bridge ,while you change your mind you can reset that, a kind of buffer to provide the change to regret and also a great way to commit the files in one logic.
