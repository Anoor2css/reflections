When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

collabrate with other guys, or just do some remote work which just online

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

pull changes manually can make a better backup, as we can automatically stay changes on the local repository, no need to update all online, the remote repository should be a rather complete and readable 
there is a buffer before push all the commits to remote repository
