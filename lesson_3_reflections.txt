When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

collabrate with other guys, or just do some remote work which just online

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

pull changes manually can make a better backup, as we can automatically stay changes on the local repository, no need to update all online, the remote repository should be a rather complete and readable 
there is a buffer before push all the commits to remote repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks: clone from others' repository (online) to my remote repository on Github
clones: from local to local or from online to local
branches: local computer to add a new subbranch to add some new but not 
exactly needed to be on the master branch.
